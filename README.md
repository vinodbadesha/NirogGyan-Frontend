NirogGyan

NirogGyan - Doctor Appointment Booking Application.
A user-friendly web application that allows users to search and book appointments with verified medical specialists. 
Built with ReactJS, this project demonstrates seamless data fetching, routing and user-centric design.

Though developing backend is optional, I chose to develop the server and database making it a full-stack project. Thus, enhancing my skills.

Tools & Libraries
1. Backend (Github Repo - https://github.com/vinodbadesha/NirogGyan.git)
	NodeJS and ExpressJS - For API development
	SQL - To maintain the data of doctors and their availabilities
	Deployment - Deployed the backend in Render to make it live and easily connect with the client-side.
		(Deployed URL - https://niroggyan-es0u.onrender.com/doctors)

2. Frontend
	ReactJS - Core JavaScript library to develop user interface
	React Router DOM - For routing and navigation between components
	React Hooks (useState, useEffect) - To maintain state variables that change with time
	React Loader Spinner - A pre-designed component to handle Asynchronous operations
	React icons - To enhance the user interface
	ContextAPI - For global state management
	CSS - For styling the application
	React Forms with form validation, React modals
	Deployment - Deployed the client-side using Vercel

Improvements
1. Responsive layout - I would update the layout to responsive making it compatible and available in different screen sizes namely mobile phones, tablets and computers.
2. Authentication - I would add a login and signup feature to track the previous appointments.
3. Virtual medical reports - I would try to achieve the possibility of storing medical reports virtually in the account itself. It would be lot more easier for the doctor to check the previous reports within a moment and patients need not have to carry physical copies.
